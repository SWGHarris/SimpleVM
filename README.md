# SimpleVM
A Virtual Machine in C. Executes a binary object file of LC-3 assembly instructions.

The purposes of this project include:
  - Learn how a basic VM works
  - Practicing C language
  - Working with bit operations
  - Gain a better understanding of assembly languages 

No Assembly was used in this project, but there is translation of Assembly instructions to a C implementation. It is also a good way to visualize what a CPU is doing with registers. These were all topics that were covered in CMSC216 (University of Maryland), which is the most recent CS course I have taken (12/2021).
