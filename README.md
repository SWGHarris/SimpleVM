# SimpleVM
A 16bit Virtual Machine in C

The purposes of this project are to practice using C, bit operations, and Assembly. No Assembly was used in this project, but there is translation of Assembly instructions to a C implementation. It is also a good way to visualize what a CPU is doing wiht registers. These were all topics that were covered in CMSC216 (University of Maryland), which is the most recent CS course I have taken at then time writing this.
